# Movie-Recommendation-System

In this notebook, we have analysed the data from movielens dataset and tried to implement recommender system for movies. For this dataset, our main challenge was sparsity of user-movie matrix which means that the number of movie which are rated by user are very less compared to number of movies which are not rated by that same user. As part of data pre-processing, various type of matrix formation has been implemented as per the requirement of all algorithms used in this notebook. we have tried to analyse both neural network and tradition algorithms for recommender system in this notebook. In deep learning, we have implemented Restricted boltzmann machine, Deep Autoencoder, and simple deep neural network to predict the ratings and provide the recommendation based of predicted ratings for the user which has not rated that movie before in the dataset. In traditional algorithms, we have implemented various method of collaborative filtering such as SVD Matrix factorization, SVD++ and Hybrid model. Our analysis is centric towards the results achieved from deep learning algorithms and traditional algorithms by comparing the MSE cost function for all.
